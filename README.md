# covid19

Covid19 is a flask application that tracks and shows the statistics on the Corona Virus disease outbreak. 

The script to query and store the information displayed can be found on the scripts folders and should be run before starting the app, you can then run it in a cron-job every 1 minute. We recommend looking at the documentation in [Covid Python Library](https://pypi.org/project/covid/).
